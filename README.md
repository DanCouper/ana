## Elixir

## Game Programming

### Blogs - Game Programming

**[Red Blob Games](http://www.redblobgames.com/)** Phenomenal source of useful information - introductions to pathfinding, A*, tiling methods and algorithms, etc. Well written, in-depth, excellent diagrams. Highly applicable outside of game programming/design. Articles are consistently reposted on HN for a reason.

## General CS/Programming

### Papers - General CS/Programming

- [**Push-Pull FRP**](papers/push-pull-frp.pdf).
  Elliott, C. (2011) [*Push-Pull Functional Reactive Programming*](papers/push-pull-frp.pdf) Haskell '09. Edinburgh, Scotland.
- [**Worlds**](papers/tr2011001_final_worlds.pdf). Interesting paper which (to quote) "introduces worlds, a language construct that reifies the notion of program state and enables programmers to control the scope of side effects."

  Warth, A., Ohshima, Y., Kaehler, T., Kay, A. (2011) [*Worlds: Controlling the Scope of Side Effects*](papers/tr2011001_final_worlds.pdf) VPRI Technical Report TR-2011-001. Glendale, California: Viewpoints Research Institute.

## Haskell

### Articles/Tutorials - Haskell
**[What I wish I knew When Learning Haskell](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask).** Useful, in-depth set of notes - on GitHub at https://github.com/sdiehl/wiwinwlh/.

**[http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Haskell-the-Hard-Way/](Learn Haskell Fast and Hard).** Short, dense tutorial on Haskell basics.

**[http://www.willamette.edu/~fruehr/haskell/evolution.html](The Evolution of a Haskell Programmer).**
> I suppose this is what you’d have to call “small-audience” humour.

## JavaScript

### Articles/Tutorials - JS

**[Higher-order Javascript](http://interglacial.com/hoj/hoj.html).** Companion piece to *Higher-order Perl* 

**[A Monad in Practicality](http://robotlolita.me/2013/12/08/a-monad-in-practicality-first-class-failures.html).** Using monads in JS to deal with failures. By Quildreen Motta - see also her [Folktale](https://github.com/folktale) library.

**[Event Driven & FRP Step-by-Step](http://open.bekk.no/event-driven-and-functional-reactive-programming-step-by-step).** Good, well written tutorial, and rest of the articles on the site are a useful resource.

### Blogs - JS

**(Better World by Better Software)[http://bahmutov.calepin.co/]** - Gleb Bahmutov's blog - fairly functional JavaScript advice.

**(Perfection Kills)[http://perfectionkills.com]** - Juriy "kangax" Zaytsev's JS blog. Very well written articles - (this one in particular)[http://perfectionkills.com/exploring-canvas-drawing-techniques/], on canvas drawing techniques. Also see his ES6 Compatibility table at http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/.

### Libraries/Frameworks - JS

**[Bacon.js](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js)** - good FRP library. Built to deal with perceived shortcomings of the [MS Cloud Programmibility Group's](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions) RXJS library.
